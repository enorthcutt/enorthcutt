Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an advance learning program and reminding my way. 
- 🌱 I’m currently relearning the things I have forgotten while expanding my knowledge on the Wonderland of code.
- 👯 I’m looking to learn more and find someone who doesn't mind a rookie with very little private experience and no professional experience.
- 🤔 I’m looking to help others who are just discovering the rabbit hole and were late to the journey, as I was.
- 💬 Ask me about the tea... wait, time to move already.
- 📫 How to reach me: not yet known.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her/It and others that are not so nice.
- ⚡ Poking someone with a stick does nothing, so wait for them to decide on their own terms and their own journey. 🚶‍♀️⏳✨ #Patience #Journey #Decision.
